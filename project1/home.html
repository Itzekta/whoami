				<h2>About me:</h2>
				<p>Hello my name is Ekta Ghimire. I started at CCBC in the fall of 2022, where I am majoring in Information Technology. I've been in Baltimore for the past seven years. I was born in Nepal, but my family eventually moved here in search of better job prospects. I had planned to major in marketing, but after seeing numerous opportunities exist in technology, I decided that a career in information technology would be a better fit for me. It's difficult for me to pick just one path because there are so many things in the world that I'm interested in, such as traveling, music, and tennis.</p>
